# How the ROF LMS frontend and backend work together

Two independent repositories, deployed separately:

| | Repository | Hosting | Production address |
|---|---|---|---|
| Frontend (Next.js 16) | `ROFFRONTENDTEST` | Netlify | `https://roflms.netlify.app` |
| Backend (NestJS, Prisma) | `ROFBACKENDTEST` | Render (+ Neon PostgreSQL, Cloudflare R2, Resend) | `https://rofbackendtest.onrender.com` |

The same text is kept in both repositories (`INTEGRATION.md` in the frontend,
`docs/INTEGRATION.md` in the backend).

## Request paths

```
Browser ──(same origin)──► Netlify site /api/*  ──CDN proxy──► Render backend /api/v1/*
Browser ──(cross-origin, uploads only)──────────────────────► Render backend /api/v1/*
Backend ──► Resend (e-mail) · Neon (database) · R2 (files)
```

- **API calls** use `/api/v1/...` on the frontend's own origin. Netlify proxies
  them to the backend (`netlify.toml` `[[redirects]]`); locally the rewrite in
  `next.config.ts` does it (`API_PROXY_TARGET`). No CORS is involved.
- **File uploads** (multipart) go straight to the backend
  (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_UPLOAD_ORIGIN`), because Netlify's proxy limits bodies to
  about 8 MB and the backend accepts up to 50 MB. They send the bearer token
  only (no cookies). The backend allows them through `CORS_ORIGINS`, and the
  frontend's CSP allows that one origin in `connect-src`.
  Multipart requests are sent with `XMLHttpRequest` (fetch cannot report upload
  progress); one progress box (`app/components/ui/UploadProgress.tsx`) shows the
  percentage for every upload and warns before the tab is closed mid-upload.
  Pickers check the file type (extension), size and count before sending; the
  backend checks the real type from the content.
- **Downloads** (`/file` endpoints, CSV exports) go through the proxy with the
  bearer token and are saved from a `blob:` URL. No storage (R2) address or
  credential ever reaches the browser: files are streamed by the backend.

## Authentication

- `POST /auth/login` returns a 15-minute **access token** (kept in memory by
  the frontend, sent as `Authorization: Bearer`) and sets the **refresh
  cookie** `rof_refresh`: httpOnly, `SameSite=Strict`, path `/api/v1/auth`,
  `Secure` in production. It works because the proxy keeps everything on one
  origin.
- On a 401 the frontend calls `POST /auth/refresh` once (single-flight across
  tabs) and retries; refresh tokens rotate on every use, and reuse revokes the
  session. `POST /auth/logout` ends it.
- Roles: `STUDENT`, `MENTOR` (shown as "Coach"), `ADMIN`. The backend enforces
  every permission (403 `FORBIDDEN`); the frontend only hides what a role
  cannot use (`GET /me/permissions`).

## Errors

Every backend error has one shape, which the frontend's `ApiError` reads:

```json
{ "statusCode": 400, "error": "Bad Request", "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED",
  "message": "Request validation failed.", "details": ["…"], "requestId": "…" }
```

## E-mail links

The backend builds links from its `APP_URL` (the frontend's address):
`/reset-password?token=…`, `/activate?token=…`, `/login`, and deep links such
as `/assignments/:id`. The frontend serves each of these routes.

## Settings that must match

| Backend (Render) | Frontend (Netlify, `netlify.toml`) |
|---|---|
| `APP_URL` = the Netlify site address | — |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` = the Netlify site address (exact, no trailing slash) | `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_UPLOAD_ORIGIN` = backend address |
| service address `https://rofbackendtest.onrender.com` | `API_PROXY_TARGET` and the `/api/*` redirect target = backend address |

## Test results (2026-11-07)

**Local, both apps running, browser-equivalent requests through the frontend's `/api` proxy, uploads cross-origin as in production:**

- 39/39 general journeys: public pages, error shape, student login → refresh cookie (httpOnly, Strict, `/api/v1/auth`) → silent refresh with rotation → logout, 403 for other roles, coach upload → publish → student download byte-for-byte, disguised executable refused (`FILE_TYPE_NOT_ALLOWED`), admin dashboard/reports/CSV.
- 26/26 assessment workflow: coach drafts an assignment with a brief → admin publishes → student downloads the brief and uploads a solution (re-upload = revision 2) → admin assigns a coach → coach downloads the solution, marks 16/20 with written feedback and a feedback file (score above maximum refused) → admin approves and publishes → student sees score, percentage, feedback, downloads the feedback file; internal notes hidden; notifications and unread counter; students cannot mark, coaches cannot publish.
- 12 MB direct upload with CORS preflight; foreign origins refused.

**Production (read-only or approved):**

- Backend `/health`: database up, storage up; health is ~300 ms slower than a database-only call, consistent with a live R2 bucket check.
- CORS: `https://roflms.netlify.app` allowed, with credentials.
- E-mail: an approved password-reset e-mail to the admin was **delivered** by Resend from `Rwanda Olympiad Foundation <info@rwandaolympiadfoundation.org>`; its link points to `https://roflms.netlify.app/reset-password?token=…`.
- **Frontend: `https://roflms.netlify.app` serves Netlify's "Page not found" on every path.** A clean build of frontend `main` stops with "API_PROXY_TARGET must be set…" (reproduced); the `feature/production-readiness` branch sets it in `netlify.toml` and builds cleanly from a fresh clone.

Not yet possible: browser tests on the live site (needs the fixed frontend deployed), and a live upload to R2 (needs a production coach or admin login).

**Production build in a real browser (2026-11-07, headless Microsoft Edge; local `next start` of the Netlify build, API → live Render backend): 39/39**

- 8 public pages × phone (375 px), tablet (768 px), desktop (1366 px): no horizontal overflow, no broken images, every image has `alt`, every form field labelled, no script errors, **no CSP violations** (after the fix below).
- Signed-out visits to student, coach and admin pages redirect to `/login?next=…`.
- `/api` proxy: live statistics 200; session check without a cookie 401 (handled, no error shown).
- Wrong credentials: "Invalid username or password." shown, page stays on `/login`. Invalid activation link: "Link not valid" with a resend form.
- Uploads as the Netlify site sends them: CORS preflight from `https://roflms.netlify.app` → 204; a 9 MB multipart POST to Render → 401 with the CORS header (≈ 9 s, nothing stored); a foreign origin is refused. The CSP `connect-src` allows exactly the backend.
- Fixed: next/image's inline `style="color:transparent"` violated the strict CSP on every page (console errors); images now use `app/components/ui/Image.tsx`, which omits it.
